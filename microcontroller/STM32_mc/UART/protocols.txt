IO ports type:
either sending bytes or reciving bytes from external device or peripheral or processor or controller for reading ,
what ever operation the port  performing is interconnected to system bus,
the processor uses the addr decoder of port register for programming the port functions or modes,reading ports status and for writing or reading bytes.
 
port communications:
[HALF Duplex]
\\\\\\\|  -----direction of data at time 1--------> |///////
station|  <-----------direction of data at time 2---|station
///////|                                            |\\\\\\\


[FULL Duplex]
\\\\\\\|                                            |///////
station|  <-----direction of data at all time-----> |station
///////|                                            |\\\\\\\


Synchronous communication:
-when a byte(charecter) or a frame(a collection of bytes) in of the data is 
 recived or transmitted at the constant time intervals with uniform phase differences 
 its called a synchronous.
-clock signal should alwas be present,

\\\\\\\|      ---->direction of flow                  |///////
sender |110111] [11111011|11110110]...[11110111] [1111|Receiver
///////|        frame                            frame|\\\\\\\


Asynchronous communication:
-when a data byte or a collection of data bytes is recived or transmitted at variable time intervals.the communication mode is called Asynchronous.
-there will be no clock signal
-there will be pre-defined hand shaking(there will be agreement b/n transmitter and reciver)
-for eg, for every frame start bit and stop bit is agreement

        [1|11111011|0]
[start bit|  DATA  | stop bit] 


serial communication:at one particular time only one bit can be transferred on data bus one wire required and can be used for long distance.
	*types of Serial ports:
	 1.synchronous Serial Input
	 2.synchronous Serial Output
	 3.Asynchronous Serial UART input
	 4.Asynchronous Serial UART output



parallel communication:multiple bits can be transferred at particular time requires more wires short distance and expensive.
