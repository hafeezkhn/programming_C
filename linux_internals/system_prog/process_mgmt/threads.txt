----------THREADS----------
- its a lightwight process means whenever you make threads theyll share same code ,
  same data segment and everything else ,except two things that is threa local storage 
  and stack
- its light wieght it can be started fast. 
- POSIX std thread API is not included in std c, they are in libpthread library.
- more threads more faster program executed.threads are used often than fork.
- pthreads best used with programs that can be organised into discrete, independent tasks which can be execute cuncurrently
-candidates for threading(design rules whether program is threadble)
  eg: routine 1 and routine 2 can be interchanged,interleaved and/or overlapped in real time.
