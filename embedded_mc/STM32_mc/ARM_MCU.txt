[ARM Cortex-M Series]
-developed for microcontroller domain
-in M-profile there are different versions of the ARM architecture
	*ARMv6-M
	*ARMv7E-M -> M3,M4 ->harvard
	*ARMv8-M
-32 bit ISA
-In general M-profile cores are optimized for cost and energy-efficiency

[Cortex M4]
-The size of processor in terms of bits defines the maximum addressable 
 range or the maximum address range it can handle. 
 For example, ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers can handle 2^32 = 4GB of memory address space.
-The 32-bit also means the size of internal registers of the processor. 
 All internal registers such as general purpose and special function, are of 32-bit.
-The datapaths, functional units ( ALU) which perform arithmetic (addition, subtraction, 
 multiplication, etc) and logical operations ( AND, OR, less than, greater than, etc) on data 
 are also of 32-bit size.
-Bus interfaces such as memory/data buses are also 32-bit.
-The Cortex-M microcontrollers are based on the ARMv7 
 processor and this processor has a set of internal registers known as a register bank.
 This register bank consists of 16 registers ranging from R0-R16. First 13 registers from R0-12 
 are general purpose registers and last three from R12-R15 are special function registers. 
-General Purpose Registers (GPR)
 General purpose registers are divided into two groups .i.e.lower registers (R0-R7) and higher 
 registers(R8-R12). 
 GPR are used to store addresses and data which is currently under process. 
-Special Function Registers(SFR)
  >In special function registers, R13 (SP) is a stack pointer and it holds the address of the 
   top element of the stack.
  >R14 is a link register LR and it is used to store the return address of the functions.
  >R15 (PC) is a program counter and it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. 
   Program counter value automatically increases by 4 after every instruction execution so that 
   it points to the next instruction address.
-Special Registers
 Other than register bank, the processor also has special registers that contain 
 the program status such as operational status,system interrupts. These status registers are:
  >PSR ( Program status register)
  >PRIMASK
  >FAULTMASK
  >BASEPRI
  >CONTROL
-Load Store Architecture
 ARM Cortex-M4 is based on load store architecture. In a load store architecture, whenever a 
 processor wants to perform operation on data which is stored inside memory, the processor 
 first loads this data from memory to one of the internal registers of the processor. 
 After processing,data will be written back to memory only if it is required. 
-Cortex-M4 Main Components 
  >Processor core
  >NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)
  >Debug system
  >Bus system and bus matrix
  >Memory
  >Peripheral

-On the other extreme we can say that Cortex-M4 is basically a cortex-M3 profile with the 
 integration of a DSP unit in it. The instruction set architecture used in cortex-M4 is Thumb-2
 which is a mixture of 32 bit ARM instruction set architecture and 16 bit Thumb instruction 
 set architecture. However, cortex-M4 adds a range of SIMD (single instruction multiple data) 
 instructions to optimize the use and functioning of digital signal processing.
