---STM32F4X------------------------------------------------------------
[Memory map of MCU(microcontroller unit)]
- uses ARM cortex M4,which has system bus width 32bits
- the processor can produce 4G different addr 
- So,memory map starts from 0x0000_0000 and ends 0xffff_ffff
- looking at reference manual for STM32 finding section on memory map
	*what is: 
	 1.base addr of AHB1 BUS peripheral registers?
	 2.base addr of GPIOA register?
	 3.base addr of APB1 peripheral registers?
	 4.base addr of FLASH memory?
	 5.base addr of SRAM2?
	 6.base addr of ADC and RCC(reset and clock control) register?

[MCU Bus interfaces] .i.e. from cortex M4 we get:
  I-BUS: The processor(M4) fetches instruction from flash over IBus, that 
	 means MCU manufacturer(STM) makes sure that the flash is actually 
	 connected to the I-BUS 
  D-BUS: Data is fetched over Dbus (ro-data from flash)
  S-BUS: system bus

(ref.TRM_M4 ull find bus interfaces in that , Icode,Dcode,system bus)
*in flash memory we have instuctions,ro-data,and vector table

[BUS MATRIX]
-Multi AHB bus matrix,we have multiple AHB busses on the slave side
-defines path to communicate from Master to slave  
-in MC the communication b/n processor to peripheral is seen from the scope of 
 master to the slave
-microcontroller Cortex M4 is master and it may have other master like,
 Ethernet,High speed USB2.0,DMA1,DMA2
-w.k.t processor M4 has 3 busses(I-Bus,D-bus,S-bus) to communicate with slave
 i.e. D-Bus to communicate to SRAM1(112kb),SRAM2(16kb),FSMC(external mem controller)
 and DBUS can also talk to the FLASH(1M) to fetch data,
-similarly IBUS talks to two different slaves FSMC and Flash
-And SBUS can talk to AHB1,AHB2,SRAM1,SRAM2,FSMC but it cannot talk to Flash.

[CLOCKS]
-various digital componets need clock for sync with MC
-for diff Applications different clock configuration is required for eg,
 if your application targets low power domain, then you may have to be careful with the
 frequency of clock which you are using in your application,bcz there is relation 
 b/n power consumption and the frequency of the clock.
