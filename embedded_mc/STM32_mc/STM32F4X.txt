---STM32F4X------------------------------------------------------------
Memory map of MCU(microcontroller unit)
- uses ARM cortex M4,which has system bus width 32bits
- the processor can produce $G different addr 
- So,memory map starts from 0x0000_0000 and ends 0xffff_ffff
- looking at reference manual for STM32 finding section on memory map
	*what is: 
	 1.base addr of AHB1 BUS peripheral registers?
	 2.base addr of GPIOA register?
	 3.base addr of APB1 peripheral registers?
	 4.base addr of FLASH memory?
	 5.base addr of SRAM2?
	 6.base addr of ADC and RCC register?

MCU Bus interfaces .i.e. from cortex M4 we get:
  I-BUS: The processor(M4) fetches instruction from flash over IBus, that 
	 means MCU manufacturer(STM) makes sure that the flash is actually 
	 connected to the I-BUS 
  D-BUS: Data is fetched over Dbus (ro-data from flash)
  S-BUS: system bus

(ref.TRM_M4 ull find bus interfaces in that , Icode,Dcode,system bus)
*in flash memory we have instuctions,ro-data,and vector table
